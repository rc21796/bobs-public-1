# After Surgery

-   You will be taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Your pain level will be assessed, vital signs monitored, and an x-ray of your new joint may be taken.
-   Depending on the type of anesthesia used, you may experience blurred vision, a dry mouth, and chills.
-   Only one or two very close family members or friends should visit you on surgery day.
-   You should be able to walk or sit in a chair. Mobility helps to relieve discomfort. It is important you begin ankle pumps to help prevent blood clots from forming in your legs.
-   A physical therapist may evaluate you.
-   Begin using your Incentive Spirometer and doing the deep breathing exercises you learned.
