hello,

Simplest, easiest, fastest? While being just as secure (if not more so) than with any “cloud” service?

Look into [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/ "syncthing.net"). Encrypted sync between two or more computers / phones / etc. without any sort of intermediate server holding the data. Can have as many folders as you like shared to/from/between (both one way as well as back and forth per your choice) as many devices as you please.

Uses whatever network works fastest between any two devices, automatically as and when the sync happens. Be that a LAN, WiFi or across the internet.
