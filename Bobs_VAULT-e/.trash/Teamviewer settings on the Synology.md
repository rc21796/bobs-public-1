Homemade Emergency Baby Formula Recipe  
  
This recipe, based on World Health Organization guidelines and physician studies through the early twentieth century, is an excellent stop-gap option for when your baby is hungry and you have no other feeding options. It is meant for short-term use only.  
  
Prep Time5 minutes  
Total Time5 minutes  
  
  
Course: baby food  
Cuisine: Global  
  
Servings: 1 quart (32 fl oz // 946 mL)  
  
Equipment  
• 1 quart-sized canning jar with a tight-fitting lid OR a blender  
  
  
Ingredients  
  
FOR THE FORMULA:  
◇  
  
1 13-ounce can (354 mL) full-fat evaporated milk  
◇ 2 ⅓ cups (19 fluid ounces // 562 mL) clean water, preferably slightly warm  
◇ 2 tablespoons blackstrap molasses  
  
  
  
TO GIVE SEPARATELY AS A NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT:  
◇ 1 dose multi-vitamin for infants, given daily (follow the dosage instructions on the multivitamin bottle)  
  
  
  
  
Instructions  
◇ Mix the formula. Place all ingredients in a clean, quart-sized jar with a tight-fitting lid or in a blender. Shake or blend until well-mixed. (If you're using granulated sugar, be sure to mix until it has been dissolved.)  
  
◇  
  
Feed the baby. Pour into clean bottles and give to baby immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to three days. Discard any unused formula after three days.  
  
◇ Give a multivitamin supplement, if available. Give one dose of multivitamin to your baby at least once a day.  
  
  
  
  
  
Notes  
  
How many batches of formula do I need?  
1 batch will likely last you approximately 1 day, give or take a few hours.  
Follow your child's hunger cues – these values are simply average guidelines.  
◇ 0-2 months: 2-3 ounces every 2-3 hours (approximately 24 oz per day)  
◇ 2-3 months: 4-5 ounces every 3-4 hours (approximately 32 oz per day)  
◇ 4-5 months: 4-6 ounces every 3-4 hours (approximately 32-36 oz per day)  
◇ 6+ months: 6-8 ounces every 4-5 times a day (approximately 32-40 oz per day)  
  
If you have multivitamin drops, give them separately from the formula to make sure your child gets the entire dose.  
  
Why is there sugar in this recipe?  
Sugar is used to bring the evaporated milk up closer to the level of natural sugars in human breast milk. We're calling for blackstrap molasses as the sugar because it also contains iron, sodium, and potassium.  
  
What can I use instead of molasses?  
If you do not have blackstrap molasses, you may substitute an equal amount of brown sugar, granulated sugar, dark corn syrup (preferably GMO-free) OR maple syrup.  
DO NOT USE sweetened condensed milk, as it contains FAR too much sugar.  
DO NOT USE HONEY as a sugar substitute if your baby is under 12 months old.
