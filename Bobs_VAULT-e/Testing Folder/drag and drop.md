## Obsidian Mobile
When using Obsidian on a mobile device, the Advanced Tables plugin can be used. Using Enter and Tab to navigate the table will not work, however you can add the "Next Cell" and "Next Row" commands to the mobile toolbar and use them to navigate, or use the buttons from the sidebar.
